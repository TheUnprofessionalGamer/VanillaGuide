Overview
============
* This is a rough port of my own leveling guide into VanillaGuide for Vanilla WoW (1.12)

* You can install [Guide Creator](https://github.com/Zarant/GuideCreator/tree/classic) to enable automatic step completion

* I highly recommend using this with [TomTom](https://github.com/cralor/TomTomVanilla) to generate accurate waypoints

* ONLY ALLIANCE IS ADDED YET!!!

* !!!HORDE IS WIP!!!
